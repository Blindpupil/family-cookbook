# Family Cookbook (Example of domain driven architecture in the frontend)

This project showcases some of my takes on domain driven architecture in the frontend. Read more about it [here](https://betterprogramming.pub/domain-driven-architecture-in-the-frontend-i-d27fb71b5cb0) 
or [here](https://dev.to/blindpupil/domain-driven-architecture-in-the-frontend-i-1f41).
"Family Cookbook" represents an application to share recipes with your loved ones.

## Classic vs Hexagon implementation
Under  `src/classic` you will find an example implementation of the app using the classic architecture we usually find across 
most Vue apps. 

Under `src/hexagon` is the same application using most of the ideas of Hexagonal Domain Driven Design.


## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
